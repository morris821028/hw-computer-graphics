## HW 1 - Multiple Shading and Transformation ##

[Demo on Github](https://morris821028.github.io/hw-computer-graphics/hw1-shading-cmp/WebGL/)

1. Flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading with Phong illumination model in shaders. You can demonstrate the three shading computation in a single object.
2. Enable multiple shaders and transformation on multiple objects in a scene. You are free to use those provided model files and arrange them to form the scene on your own style. You must show the three shading simultaneously on different objects in your scene.
